<h1>Configure DHCP on a Wireless Router</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This GitHub repository showcases the accomplishment of a Cisco Networking Lab focused on configuring DHCP on a wireless router. Through step-by-step instructions, I connected PCs to the router, modified DHCP settings for a specific IP range, and ensured clients obtained automatic IP addresses. The lab offers a practical insight into DHCP setup and networking fundamentals, providing a valuable resource for those seeking to enhance their understanding of dynamic IP allocation within a network environment.
